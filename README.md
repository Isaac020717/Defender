Defender is a fun wave based platformer game made entirely in processing by Isaac Giles.
The game was made in only 2 months for my ics3u course.

To run the game you will need to download the files and run them in processing.
The game also uses the minim sound library which is required to run the game.
You can import the minim library in the processing IDE (Sketch>Import Library>Add Library...)
and then just do a search for 'Minim'.
